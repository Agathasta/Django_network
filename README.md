# NETWORK

## [CS50 Web Design Project 4](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/4/network)

Design a Twitter-like social network website for making posts and following users.

TECHNOLOGIES USED  

* HTML
* CSS
* JAVASCRIPT
* PYTHON
* DJANGO

1. MODELS  
I decided to use only 2 models, User and Post, related through a ForeignKey.  
Followers/following can be logged in a recursive ManyToMany relationship in User. Symmetry needs to be set to False and blank to True.  
The likes can be a ManyToMany relationship between User and Post, with blank set to True.  

2. CSS
I am not using Bootstrap.  
I have copied the normalize.css to normalize (duh) the starting css.  
Looking at OOCSS, SMACSS, ITCSS, ACSS and BEM. Ummm.  
Decide to use SCSS: <https://engineertodeveloper.com/how-to-easily-use-sass-scss-with-django/>  

3. ALL POSTS, ADD POST
I first did everything with Python and it worked fine, but I decided to try to implement JS for creating new posts and updating the post list asynchronously.  
* After a trillion trial and error, I managed to get it as I wanted it: the form is generated by Python, but JS sends the new posts. It wouldn't work with JSON, but it does with FormData.  
* To modify the DOM, I discovered document fragments. I now create all the divs I need (to later be able to style the post) in a for loop, adding classes and content to each, and append them to the fragment. This is more compact and I only modify the DOM once with every post. Twice, because I add the like icon at the end (could I access the one div while still in the fragment? I certainly could in the loop, with a conditional).  
* I decided to store the CSRF token in the session and not in a cookie, because getting that seemed overly complicated.  

4. PAGINATION
Copied the code from the Django documentation. To style it, I looked at Bootstrap's style and adapted it.
